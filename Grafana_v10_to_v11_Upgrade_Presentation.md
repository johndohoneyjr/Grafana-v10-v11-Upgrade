---

## Slide 4: Pre-Upgrade Assessment - Environment Inventory
**Technical Checklist:**
âœ“ Current Grafana v10.x version
âœ“ Deployment method (Docker/Package/K8s)
âœ“ Installed plugins and versions
âœ“ Custom configurations
âœ“ Data sources configuration
âœ“ Dashboards, alerts, notifications
âœ“ Database backend type
âœ“ Authentication providers

**Critical Success Factor:** Complete visibility into current state

---

## Slide 5: Pre-Upgrade Assessment - Compatibility Check
**Compatibility Matrix:**
- Plugin compatibility with v11
- Data source compatibility
- Custom theme compatibility
- API integrations validation
- Provisioning configurations

**Risk Indicators:**
ðŸ”´ High Risk: Custom plugins, complex integrations
ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk: Standard plugins, multiple data sources
ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk: Fresh install, standard configuration

---

## Slide 6: Upgrade Process - The Four Phases
1. **Backup Phase**
   - Database backup
   - Configuration backup
   - Dashboard export

2. **Service Management**
   - Stop Grafana service
   - Prepare for upgrade

3. **Upgrade Execution**
   - Package/Container/K8s update
   - Version verification

4. **Post-Upgrade**
   - Configuration updates
   - Service restart
   - Plugin updates

---

## Slide 7: Backup Strategy - Critical First Step

**Standard Grafana:**
```bash
# Database Backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U grafana_user grafana_db > \
  grafana_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Configuration Backup
cp -r /etc/grafana /etc/grafana_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

**Azure Managed Grafana:**
```bash
# Variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="your-rg"
GRAFANA_INSTANCE="your-grafana"
BACKUP_PATH="/backup/grafana_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# Complete AMG Backup
az grafana backup --name $GRAFANA_INSTANCE \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --output-path $BACKUP_PATH
```

**Golden Rule:** No backup = No upgrade

---

## Slide 8: Alert Backup Strategy - New Complexity in v11

**Alert Types to Consider:**
- **Prometheus Rules**: Managed by Prometheus, backed up separately
- **Grafana-Managed Alerts**: Stored in Grafana database
- **Azure Monitor Alerts**: Managed by Azure, preserved independently
- **Legacy Alerts**: May need migration

**Key Challenge:** Different alert types require different backup approaches

**Solution:** Comprehensive alert-aware backup scripts that handle all types

---

## Slide 9: Deployment Methods - Choose Your Path

**Package-Based (Traditional)**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install grafana=11.x.x
```

**Container-Based (Modern)**
```bash
docker pull grafana/grafana:11.x.x
```

**Azure Managed Grafana**
```bash
# Upgrade handled by Azure, but backup/restore is critical
az grafana restore --name $INSTANCE --input-path $BACKUP_PATH
```

---

## Slide 10: Automation Possibilities - Scale with Confidence

**Infrastructure as Code**
- Ansible playbooks for repeatable upgrades
- Terraform for infrastructure management (with in-place upgrade safety)
- Configuration management

**Container Orchestration**
- Kubernetes rolling updates
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated health checks

**CI/CD Integration**
- GitLab/GitHub Actions
- Automated testing pipelines
- Staged deployments

**Azure Managed Grafana**
- Azure CLI automation for backup/restore
- ARM templates for infrastructure
- Azure DevOps pipeline integration

---

## Slide 11: Automation Example - Alert-Aware Backup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Comprehensive Alert Backup Script
GRAFANA_URL="http://localhost:3000"
API_KEY="your-api-key"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Grafana-managed alerts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "$GRAFANA_URL/api/ruler/grafana/api/v1/rules" > \
  $BACKUP_DIR/grafana_alerts.json

# Prometheus rules (if accessible)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "$GRAFANA_URL/api/ruler/prometheus/api/v1/rules" > \
  $BACKUP_DIR/prometheus_alerts.json

# Notification policies
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "$GRAFANA_URL/api/v1/provisioning/policies" > \
  $BACKUP_DIR/notification_policies.json
```

## Slide 12: Common Pitfalls - What Can Go Wrong?

**Top 9 Pitfalls:**
1. **Plugin Incompatibility** - Critical plugins may break
2. **Database Migration Issues** - Schema changes cause failures
3. **Configuration Breaking Changes** - Syntax updates required
4. **Dashboard Compatibility** - Panel types may change
5. **Authentication Provider Changes** - SSO configurations affected
6. **Performance Degradation** - Resource requirements may increase
7. **AngularJS Deprecation** - Panels disabled by default in v11
8. **Alert Rule Migration** - Different types need different approaches
9. **Terraform Data Loss** - Full redeployment vs in-place upgrade

**Key Insight:** Most issues are preventable with proper testing

---

## Slide 13: Mitigation Strategies
**For Each Pitfall:**

**Plugin Issues** â†’ Test in staging + have fallbacks
**Database Problems** â†’ Always backup + test migration
**Config Changes** â†’ Review docs + validate settings
**Dashboard Issues** â†’ Export dashboards + test critical ones
**Auth Problems** â†’ Test authentication + backup admin access
**Performance** â†’ Monitor resources + plan for scaling
**AngularJS** â†’ Enable feature toggle: `GF_FEATURE_TOGGLES_ANGULARDEPRECATIONUI=true`
**Alert Migration** â†’ Use alert-type-specific backup/restore scripts
**Terraform** â†’ Configure in-place upgrades, avoid full redeployment

---
